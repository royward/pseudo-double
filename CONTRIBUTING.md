## How to contribute to pseudo-double

Contributions are welcome. You can help build this out to be a robust useful resource.

### Did you find a bug?

Please file a ticket. Include what function failed or returned the incorrect result, what the input(s) were, and what the unexpected result/error was. A small sample of compilable code would be ideal.

### Do you want to add a new function?

It would be relatively easy to add new functions using the current function as a guide. Then file a pull request. Alternatively, file a ticket and I may get to it.

### Do you want to improve the accuracy of some trancendental functions?

Many of the transcendental functions are not as accurate as they could be. If you need more accuracy, rerun lolremez to get more terms and adjust the function accordingly, then file a pull request. Alternatively, file a ticket and I may get to it.

### Can you speed up a function?

I really wany to hear about that! File a pull request with your improvements.

### Have you seen an improvement that could be made to the docs?

Better documenatation means a better project. Please file a pull request with any changes you think would make the docs better. Filling out Functions.md would be especially welcome.
